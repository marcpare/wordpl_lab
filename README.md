TODO
====

* Are there heuristics for pruning third guess words?
* Gather best third guess words after 1k, 10k assessments to speed up future assessments


Results
=======

Strategy: e4/e4.json
Epsilon: 12.35


Notes
=====

* Prune third guess search with a cut-off (if expected to win within epsilon of perfect, done)
    -> doesn't work as epsilon grows wide variation in difference between best wins and best possible
